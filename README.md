# Code kata: Anagram

## **Summary**

The solution to the challenge posed in this kata is written in node js

## **About this Kata**

This Kata was posted as the problem to be solved in a “self-documenting code contest”: [http://selfexplanatorycode.blogspot.com/2008/08/announcing-self-documenting-code.html](http://selfexplanatorycode.blogspot.com/2008/08/announcing-self-documenting-code.html)

## **Problem Description**

Write a program that generates all two-word anagrams of the string “documenting”. Here’s a word list you might want to use: [https://gist.githubusercontent.com/calvinmetcalf/084ab003b295ee70c8fc/raw/314abfdc74b50f45f3dbbfa169892eff08f940f2/wordlist.txt](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/calvinmetcalf/084ab003b295ee70c8fc/raw/314abfdc74b50f45f3dbbfa169892eff08f940f2/wordlist.txt)

## **Clues**

You should think about the performance of your solution and whether making it faster affects readability.

## **Suggested Test Cases**

After programing the first version with TDD appraoch it is very interesing to take different appraoches to this problem and reuse your tests. If you use parallel/multi-threading - will your tests still verify your solution or will they fail cuz they assumed a particular order? What is the most time consuming operation in your solution? Can you go crazy optimizing it and still be sure you solution works thanks to tests? A note for .NET programers: sorting takes quite some time, can you do it faster?
